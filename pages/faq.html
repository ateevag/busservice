                  <b>Is it mandatory to take a printout of the ticket?</b>
                  <br> It depends on the bus operator you have booked your ticket with. Even mTickets are available on
                  redBus. For operators that support mTickets, the SMS that is sent to your mobile can be produced
                  at the time of boarding and you will be allowed to travel.
                  <br> For operators that do not support mTickets it is a must to take a printout of the e-ticket and produce
                  it at the time of boarding. The e-ticket is sent to the e-mail ID provided at the time of boarding.
                  <br> To know which operators are mTicket enabled, look for the mTicket icon under the mTicket column
                  while searching for buses.

                  <b>I've lost my ticket. What should I do now?</b>
                  <br> A copy of the ticket would have been sent to you by e-mail when you booked it. Please take a printout
                  of that mail and produce it at the time of boarding. If you have not received the ticket e-mail,
                  please call any of our call centers and our executive will re-send you a copy by mail.

                  <b>What is an mTicket?</b>
                  <br> An mTicket is an SMS that is sent to your mobile on booking a ticket with select operators. This
                  SMS has the TIN number and the PNR number along with other ticket related information. It can be
                  used to board the bus. Please note that not all operators accept mTickets. To know which operators
                  are mTicket enabled, look for the mTicket icon under the mTicket column while searching for buses.

                  the Print/SMS ticket link on the home page on www.redBus.in. Enter your TIN number mentioned on the
